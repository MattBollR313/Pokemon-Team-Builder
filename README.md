# Pokemon-Team-Builder
Pokemon Team Builder using the Pokemon API, Spring Boot, and React

This project was used as my capstone for the software engineering master's program at Penn State World Campus. Throughout the development of this fullstack project, I learned how to properly build a RESTful API using Spring Boot as well as integrate that API into a MongoDB database and a React frontend. The Pokemon API is used to help build a pokemon team with various statistics displayed about them including their type, moveset, abilities, and more.

Possible future improvements include: deployment through Jenkins/OpenShift, performance improvements for API calls, and UI overhaul using React frameworks to simplify the user experience.
